# mipsasm
Project about MIPS assembler

This is a very basic MIPS assembler implementation that goes through fazes with lexer, parser and compiler. It is fully written in C++ and can be compiled both on Windows-Visual C++ and Linux-g++ with Makefile.

There is a support for errors and warnings so that you can perfectly see which line generated bugs.
